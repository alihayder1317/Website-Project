    <p class="about1">
      Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by
      the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which
      included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded
      (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The
      Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday
      mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them
      to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of
      Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the
      dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid
      president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers
      and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed
      as Madrid Football Club.
