    <h1>About Real Madrid</h1>
    <h2 class="title1">History</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="about1">
      Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by
      the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which
      included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded
      (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The
      Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday
      mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them
      to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of
      Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the
      dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid
      president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers
      and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed
      as Madrid Football Club.

    <h2 class="title2">Rivalries</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="about2">
      There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a
      national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the
      game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as "The Classic" (El
      Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as
      representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as
      well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the
      political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans,
      seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[235] Over
      the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for
      Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.
